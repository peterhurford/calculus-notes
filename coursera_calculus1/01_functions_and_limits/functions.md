## Functions

A **function** maps each number in its domain to another number.  It assigns inputs `x` to outputs `y`, though it may not be defined for all possible `x` (domain).

A function can only define one output `y` to each `x`.  If `x` can be mapped to multiple `y`, then it is not a function.  However, multiple `x` can be mapped to the same `y`.

Two functions are the same if they map the same `x` to the same `y` for all `x` defined for each function.


#### Domains

A **domain** is the set of all numbers for which a function is defined.

For example, `f(x) = 1/x` is undefined for 0, so the domain is all real numbers except 0.


#### Defining Functions

A function can be defined using a rule, like `f(x) = x^2`, but it is possible to define functions that can't fit a particular rule.

You can define functions **piecewise**, like

```
g(x) = x^2 (if x >= 5) or x - 2 (if x < 5)
```

Some functions can be a bit crazier, like

```
C(x) = the number of even difits in x (if x is a whole number) or 0 (otherwise).
```
